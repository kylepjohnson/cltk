    # The executor is the environment in which the steps below will be executed - below will use a python 3.8 container
    # Change the version below to your required version of python

    # Checkout the code as the first step. This is a dedicated CircleCI step.
    # The python orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a Pipfile via Pipenv by default.
    # Here we're making sure we use just use the system-wide pip. By default it uses the project root's requirements.txt.
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
